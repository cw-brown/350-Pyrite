Throughout this semester, our task is to design a PID controlled robot. To do this, we are utilizing a Raspberry Pi for camera detection of markers, and an Arduino for motor control and localization. The Arduino will interpret data from the camera, and drive to and from Aruco markers to complete a set course..

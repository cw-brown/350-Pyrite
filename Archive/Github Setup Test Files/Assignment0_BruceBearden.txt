'''
This python code was created to play a game of hangman between 2 users. One user would enter a secret word, and the other user would try to guess the secret word with a pre allotted amount of guesses. To run the code, simply copy this txt into a .py file and run. The first user will then enter a secret word and then the game will automatically start for the next user.
'''
'''
Pseudocode:
Step 1: Enter the input prompts for the user
Step 2: Split the secret word up into a list.
        Make a list of all underscores that is the
        same length of the secret word, this list will
        serve as the interface between the user and 
        guessing the secret word. When the program asks 
        the user for the character, it will search through 
        the secret word list and if it finds a character it
        will change the underscore list to the letter. 
Step 3: if the user guesses the word the program will 
        output the winning prompt, the amount of guesses remaining
        and the secret word separated by spaces.

# print a user interface, the user will enter a secret word and input how many possible guesses.

# turn the secret word into a secret word list
